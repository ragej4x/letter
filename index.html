                        <strong>Dear Sarah,</strong>
                        <p class="customfont">
                            I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time, but I struggled to find the right moment. From the very beginning, something about you stood out—your smile, your kindness, and the way you made me feel truly seen. Over time, those feelings only grew stronger, and now I can say with all my heart that I’ve fallen deeply in love with you.

You’ve brought so much happiness into my life, and I can’t imagine my future without you in it. My intentions are genuine—I want to be there for you, support your dreams, and create a beautiful life together. If you feel the same, I’d love to take this journey with you. And even if you're not sure yet, I’m willing to wait.
                        </p>
